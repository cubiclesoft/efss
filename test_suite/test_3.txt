	Once upon a time, there was this crazy guy named Thomas.
	And he ran a crazy company called CubicleSoft.

	He wrote a file system that did transparent encryption and compression.
	In PHP.

	It was awesome.
	Eventually people decided it was so awesome, they parted with some money.

	Thomas loves your money.
	Don't forget to donate.
